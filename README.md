# Mental Health in Tech – Exploratory Data Analysis

This repository contains an end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project focused on mental health trends in the technology industry. The project was completed as part of a data analytics internship at **Labmentix**, showcasing practical skills in data cleaning, analysis, and deriving business insights using Python and Google Colab.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `mental_health_eda.ipynb` – EDA notebook (Python, Google Colab)  
- `survey.csv` – Cleaned survey dataset used for analysis  
- `README.md` – Project overview and documentation  

---

## 🧪 Techniques Used

- Data preprocessing: handling missing values, fixing outliers, cleaning gender labels  
- Feature engineering: age grouping, binary encodings  
- Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate visual analysis  
- 20+ visualizations (countplots, heatmap, pairplot, histograms)  
- Business insight generation and recommendations  

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Respondents aged **25–35** are most likely to seek treatment  
- **Family history**, **work interference**, and **benefits access** strongly influence treatment behavior  
- Many employees are **unaware** of mental health benefits  
- **Stigma** is still a major barrier to speaking up about mental health  
- **Remote workers** are slightly less likely to seek support  

---

## ✅ Recommendations

- Improve awareness and communication about existing mental health support  
- Design inclusive programs for **younger** and **remote** employees  
- Encourage anonymous self-assessments to detect early warning signs  
- Reduce workplace stigma through **open culture and manager training**

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)  
- Google Colab  
- Markdown (for documentation)
